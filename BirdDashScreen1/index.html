            <p style="font-family: 'Bangers', cursive;">
                1. Tap to Flap: When you start the game, you control a small bird that is constantly falling. Your only input is tapping the screen. Each time you tap, the bird flaps its wings and rises slightly.<br>
                2. Navigate Obstacles: The game's objective is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes that have openings. The bird must pass through these openings to progress.<br>
                3. Avoid Collisions: You must avoid colliding with the ground or the pipes. Hitting either of these obstacles will end the game.<br>
                4. Maintain Altitude: The challenge in Flappy Bird lies in maintaining the bird's altitude. You need to time your taps carefully to keep the bird from hitting the ground or the pipes.<br>
                5. Scoring: The game keeps track of your score based on the number of pipes you successfully navigate. Each time you pass through a set of pipes, you earn one point.<br>
                6. Increasing Difficulty: As you continue to play, the game becomes more challenging. The pipes are placed closer together, and the openings may vary in size and position, making it increasingly difficult to navigate through them.<br>
                7. Endless Gameplay: Flappy Bird features endless gameplay, which means there is no ultimate goal or endpoint. Your objective is to achieve the highest score possible before you eventually collide with an obstacle and the game ends.<br>
                8. Competitive Aspect: Part of the game's appeal is the competitive aspect. Players try to beat their previous high scores or compete with friends to see who can achieve the highest score.
